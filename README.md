PyQt4 and Qt v4 are no longer supported and no new releases will be made.  

## [Kivy](https://kivy.org/)  
The Open Source Python App development Framework.  
Build and distribute beautiful Python cross-platform GUI apps with ease.  
Kivy has been built to be easy to use, cross-platform and fast.  
With a single codebase, you will be able to deploy apps on Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS and Android.  

## [wxPython](https://www.wxpython.org/)  
wxPython, the cross-platform GUI toolkit for the Python language.  
With wxPython software developers can create truly native user interfaces for their Python applications, that run with little or no modifications on Windows, Macs and Linux or other unix-like systems.  

## [PySimpleGUI](https://www.pysimplegui.org/en/latest/)

This manual is crammed full of answers so start your search for answers here. Read/Search this prior to opening an Issue on GitHub. Press Control F and type.  

## [PySide](https://pypi.org/project/PySide/)  
PySide is the Python Qt bindings project, providing access the complete Qt 4.8 framework as well as to generator tools for rapidly generating bindings for any C++ libraries.  

## [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter)  
CustomTkinter is a python UI-library based on Tkinter, which provides new, modern and fully customizable widgets.  
They are created and used like normal Tkinter widgets and can also be used in combination with normal Tkinter elements.  
The widgets and the window colors either adapt to the system appearance or the manually set mode ('light', 'dark'), and all CustomTkinter widgets and windows support HighDPI scaling (Windows, macOS).  
With CustomTkinter you'll get a consistent and modern look across all desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).  

## [Flet](https://flet.dev/docs/)  
Flet is a framework that allows building interactive multi-user web, desktop and mobile applications in your favorite language without prior experience in frontend development.  
You build a UI for your program with Flet controls which are based on Flutter by Google.   
Flet does not just "wrap" Flutter widgets, but adds its own "opinion" by combining smaller widgets, hiding complexities, implementing UI best-practices, applying reasonable defaults - all to ensure your apps look cool and professional without extra efforts.  

## [PyGObject(PyGI)](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  
PyGObject is a Python package which provides bindings for GObject based libraries such as GTK, GStreamer, WebKitGTK, GLib, GIO and many more.  
It supports Linux, Windows and macOS and works with Python 3.7+ and PyPy3.   
PyGObject, including this documentation, is licensed under the LGPLv2.1+.  
If you want to write a Python application for GNOME or a Python GUI application using GTK, then PyGObject is the way to go.   
For more information on specific libraries check out the “Python GTK 3 Tutorial” and the “Python GI API Reference”.

## [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)  
A faster way to build and share data apps  
Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.  
All in pure Python. No front‑end experience required.
